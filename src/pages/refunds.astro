  Canceling your subscription stops future charges but lets you use Pro until the end of your current billing period.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Deleting the app does NOT cancel your subscription. You must cancel through 
    your device settings to stop future charges.

  Free trials and promotional subscriptions may have different refund terms. These will be clearly stated 
  at the time of the offer.
