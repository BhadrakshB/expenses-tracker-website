      to cancel your subscription and receive a full refund—no questions asked.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="consumer-right-to-cancel">Your 14-Day Right to Cancel</h2>
  <p>
    As a consumer, you have the right to cancel your subscription within <strong
      >14 days</strong
    >
    from the day after your purchase without giving any reason. To meet the cancellation
    deadline, you must send your cancellation request before the 14-day period expires.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Full reimbursement:</strong> We will reimburse all payments received
      from you
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fast processing:</strong> Refunds are processed within 14 days of receiving

      <strong>Same payment method:</strong> Refunds are credited to your original
      payment method at no extra cost
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="digital-content-exception">Digital Content Exception</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-warning">
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Your right to cancel does not apply once you have
      started to download, stream, or otherwise acquire and use the digital content
      or Pro features included in your subscription.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    By using ExpensesTracker Pro features after purchase, you acknowledge that
    you have started accessing the digital content and may no longer be eligible
    for the automatic 14-day cancellation right.
